## How to use in demo
1. **Workflow Demo (`/demo`)**: Select a sample claim → use the file upload area to drag-and-drop matching images before running the workflow
2. **Claim Detail**: When viewing a claim, the evidence images can be uploaded via the UI
3. Images are served at `/demo-evidence/{claim-id}/{filename}` — the demoer can open them in a browser tab and drag into the upload area
